Just a scar somewhere down inside of me
Something I can not repair
Even though it will always be
I pretend it isn't there (this is how I feel)
I'm trapped in yesterday (just stay out of my way)
Where the pain is all I know (this is all I know)

And I'll never break away (can't break free)
'Cause when I'm alone

I'm lost in these memories
Living behind my own illusion
Lost all my dignity
Living inside my own confusion
